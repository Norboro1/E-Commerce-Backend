  ## Description
  This node application is comprised of strictly back-end code meant to serve as a way to communicate with a mySql database, retrieving, storing, and updating information about products as well as their categories and tags. This serves mainly to test my knowledge on the sequelize and mysql npm packages.

  ## Installation
  Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies with "npm install" command.

  ## Usage
  To use this you will need MySQL. You will need to create a .env file containing the variables "DB_NAME", "DB_USER", and "DB_PW", which should be "ecommerce_db", your MySQL username, and your MySQL password respectively. Next in your mysql terminal you will run the db/schema.sql file with "SOURCE db/schema.sql;", exit the mysql terminal and run "npm run start" to set up the necessary models/tables for the first time. Finally you may close the server (CTRL+C), run "npm run seed" to seed the database, and restart the server. You can now test all of the routes using insomnia or a similar app. See Demo video here for a more clear walkthrough [https://watch.screencastify.com/v/Nqojvhy4ozO7M9A1SUcR]
